I think the problem is that igraph is installed in /usr/local/lib/libigraph.dylib, but the linker cannot find it when Python tries to load the C core of the igraph module because /usr/local/lib is not on the default library path in Mac OS X. (At least I think so).

First, please check whether libigraph.dylib is really in /usr/local/lib - it should be there. After that, try this:

DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib python -m igraph.test.__init__
This should instruct the linker to look around in /usr/local/lib as well as the default places, and then run Python with the entire igraph test suite.
